        &gt; About me
    </h1>

    <p>I'm a 22-year-old web development student from Uruguay in Jóvenes a Programar 2025 edition.</p>

    <p> Since I was a kid, I've had a huge list of interests; programming was one of them. In school, I played with Scratch and fell in love with it. I've always been interested in technology and graphic design, especially hardware and UI/UX, so I decided to start learning web development to combine both. I love learning new things and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills. I'd say I'm "hungry to learn".</p>

    <p>I consider myself a perfectionist, so everything needs to reach a minimum level of "perfection" to me.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy listening to music and discovering new amazing pieces, playing piano, video games, and spending time procrastinating on the internet, especially on X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>
